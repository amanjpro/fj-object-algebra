## An Extensible Compiler Framework Based on Object Algebra


This project contains five components:

1. **comp1**: Implementation of an empty language

2. **comp2**: Implementation of FJ, based on **comp1**

3. **comp3**: Implementation of FJ + primitives and literals, 
   based on **comp2**

4. **comp4**: Implementation of FJ + interfaces, based on **comp2**

5. **comp5**: Implementation of FJ + primitives and literals + 
   interfaces, combines **comp3** and **comp4**
